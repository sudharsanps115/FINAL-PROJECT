FINAL PROJECT – 1
MindTrack
# Project Overview

MindTrack demonstrates an end-to-end AWS-native CI/CD pipeline for deploying a containerized web application to Amazon EKS using AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuild, 
with monitoring via Amazon CloudWatch.The application is packaged as a Docker image, automatically built and pushed to Amazon ECR, and deployed to Amazon EKS 
using Kubernetes manifests. Build, pipeline, and deployment logs are centrally monitored using CloudWatch Logs.

# Tech Stack Used

CI/CD
AWS CodePipeline
AWS CodeBuild
Docker
NGINX (serving static frontend)
Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)
Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)
Amazon CloudWatch (Logs & Metrics)

Cloud Services

AWS EC2
IAM
ECR
EKS
CloudWatch

# CI/CD Flow
GitHub -> CodePipeline -> CodeBuild -> Amazon ECR -> Amazon EKS -> CloudWatch

Flow Explanation

Code pushed to GitHub
AWS CodePipeline detects changes and triggers the pipeline

AWS CodeBuild:

Builds the Docker image
Authenticates to Amazon ECR
Pushes the image to ECR
CodeBuild deploys to EKS using kubectl apply

CloudWatch Logs captures:
CodePipeline execution logs
CodeBuild build logs
Deployment-related logs

# CI/CD Implementation (CodeBuild)

CodeBuild Responsibilities
Authenticate to Amazon ECR
Build Docker image using Dockerfile
Tag Docker image with ECR repository URI
Push image to Amazon ECR
Apply Kubernetes manifests (Deployment.yaml, Service.yaml) to EKS

# Kubernetes Deployment

Deployment Configuration

Kubernetes Deployment with 2 replicas
Ensures high availability and fault tolerance

Service Configuration
Kubernetes Service (LoadBalancer)
Exposes the application publicly

Port Mapping

Container runs on port 3000
Exposed externally via port 80 using AWS LoadBalancer

# Monitoring & Logging
CloudWatch Used For:

AWS CodeBuild Logs
Build execution
Docker build & push logs
AWS CodePipeline Logs

Pipeline stage execution
